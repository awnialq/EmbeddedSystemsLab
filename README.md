# EmbeddedSystemsLab
This was the lab for Introduction to Embedded Systems. We worked with an STM board that came with an ARM Cortex processor. We were asked to implement a couple of functions in arm32 assembly in the most efficient way we could during the lab period time. This lab was overall a very enjoyable experience.
